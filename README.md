# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository holds all the completed files for the Course project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course. The R script included assumes that the data is already downloaded and unzipped in the working directory.

`run_analysis.R` subsets the means and standard deviations of the original data.

`CodeBook.md` contains information on the variables and transformations performed on the data.

`tidydata.txt` is the end result.
